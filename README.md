# Agricultural-Commodities-Market-Data-Analysis
# ABSTRACT
The agriculture commodities market plays a vital role in the economy, directly impacting farmers, consumers, and various stakeholders. In this project, web scraping techniques, particularly Beautiful Soup, to collect data from the AGMARKET website, a valuable source of information on agricultural commodity prices. The dataset obtained includes various attributes such as State Name, District Name, Market Name, Commodity, Variety, Grade, minimum price, maximum price, modal price, Category, Season, Year, and Month.
The technique involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and time series analysis using techniques such as Autoregression (AR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), CAT Boost regression, and Gradient Boost regression to predict commodity prices and visualize the data using charts, graphs to provide insights into market trends and patterns. By understanding the market trends and seasonal variations, stakeholders can optimize production and pricing strategies to enhance efficiency and profitability in the agriculture sector.
The GUI developed using Tkinter allows users to interactively select the commodities category of interest and view the forecasted prices for the next two years. This user-friendly interface enhances accessibility and usability, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions. This project contributes to informed decision-making in the agricultural sector, empowering stakeholders to optimize pricing, procurement, and market strategies for enhanced efficiency and sustainability.

It helps draw critical conclusions and also provides with information on price trends, market dynamics and states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. By analysing the past trends and patterns, stakeholders can develop tactfully conduct the productions, marketing, and resource allocation. Emphasizing the Informed comprehension of the Purposeful trends is very ultimate for the stakeholders, farmers and traders for taking this approach to expect future market movements and configure and choose their production and sales management methods by themselves.
All these predictive techniques like ARIMA, AR, SARIMA, CAT Boost regression, and Gradient Boost regression are used by the project to get better forecasting of the commodity prices. Through data analysis and utilization of historical trends, machine learning applications uncover the complex underlying patterns and interrelationships which enable the generation of more accurate estimates of likely future price movements. Through the investigation of the agricultural commodity markets within the Indian states of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu much valuable information on price dynamics, market structures, and other supply side forces can be acquired. The enhancing of the prediction models gives stakeholders an attribute to predict commodity prices appropriately and grant them valuable insights in decision-making, as well as risk management. This strategic implementation is crucial to improve production and marketing strategies which converts the output into higher profits and ensure sustainability of agricultural industry. In addition, among other things, this represents the ability to comprehend market tendencies and foresight which will help stakeholders in their decision making process regarding the profitability and growth of their enterprise within the agricultural economy.
